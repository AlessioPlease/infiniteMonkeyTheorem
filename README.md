# Infinite Monkey
I made this Java program inspired by the [Infinite Monkey Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem).

The program will ask the user to type a word. After it received the input, it will start 
building words with [_random_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE) letters until it will 
_randomly_ type the word the user typed as input.

The program makes use of multithreading in order to provide feedback of it actually running (by default every 5 seconds), 
without weighing on performance.

## Run
To run the program execute the main function in the Monkey class.
